# Housing_Portal
<<<<<<< codex/set-up-initial-project-structure
This will be the housing portal that we will use to manage all of our payments for housing happening. 

## Development

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

This uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for a simple dev environment.
=======

This repository contains a minimal example of a housing portal using Flask.
Users can register, log in, and submit a payment through Stripe Checkout.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Set the environment variables `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` with your Stripe credentials.
- Optionally set `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` to configure the session secret.

## Running

```
python app.py
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your browser to test the payment flow.
